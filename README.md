# The focus of public discourse on the covid-19 pandemic

## Description
In 2020 the covid-19 pandemic started. For months, if not years after the start of the pandemic, whenever you turned on the news there was something about covid on. For a long time it was all there was to talk about. But did this reflect in society as well. How much did public discourse focus on the pandemic and how did the number of people discussing the pandemic increase or decrease over time? By analysing data from Twitter I hope to find out exactly that. 

## Background
Carvajal-Miranda, Christian, Luis Mañas-Viniegra, and Li Liang. "Online discourse in the context of COVID-19, the first health crisis in China after the advent of mobile social media: a content analysis of China’s Weibo and Baidu." Social Sciences 9.10 (2020): 167.

Cinelli, Matteo, et al. "The COVID-19 social media infodemic." Scientific reports 10.1 (2020): 1-10.

## Research question
How did the engagement towards covid change over the course of the pandemic?

## Hypothesis
I expect the discourse to mostly start at the end of january when the WHO declared covid a public health emergency of international concern and quickly ramping up in march when the WHO declared covid-19 a pendemic. I then expect the discourse to slowly die down again with peaks whenever a lockdown ends, starts or a new variant is discovered.

## Method
The data that i wll use will be Twitter data collected by the university of Groningen. 

I will use data starting from december 2019 when covid was first discovered up to the end of 2022.

I will collect every tweet mentioning the words "covid", "SARS‑CoV‑2" and "coronavirus" and variations of these words in the dataset and keep track of when they were sent. Then I will conduct an analysis of this data in order to find out how engagement changed over the course of the pandemic.
