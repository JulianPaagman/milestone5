# Milestone 5

## Description
In 2020 the covid-19 pandemic started and was at its height, especially in the news, but how has this widespread coverage affected general discourse. 

## Background
Carvajal-Miranda, Christian, Luis Mañas-Viniegra, and Li Liang. "Online discourse in the context of COVID-19, the first health crisis in China after the advent of mobile social media: a content analysis of China’s Weibo and Baidu." Social Sciences 9.10 (2020): 167.

Cinelli, Matteo, et al. "The COVID-19 social media infodemic." Scientific reports 10.1 (2020): 1-10.

## Research question
How did the engagement towards covid change over the course of the pandemic?

## Hypothesis
I expect the discourse to mostly start at the end of january when the WHO declared covid a public health emergency of international concern and quickly ramping up in march when the WHO declared covid-19 a pendemic. I then expect the discourse to slowly die down again with peaks whenever a lockdown ends, starts or a new variant is discovered.

## Method
The data that i wll use will be Twitter data collected by the university of Groningen. 

I will use data starting from december 2019 when covid was first discovered up to the end of 2022.

I will collect every tweet mentioning the words "covid" and "coronavirus" and variations of these words in the dataset and keep track of when they were sent. Then I will conduct an analysis of this data in order to find out how engagement changed over the course of the pandemic.
