# Milestone 5

## Description
Like Dutch, Frisian is also an official language in the Netherlands, Frisian is pretty much exclusively spoken in Friesland, but to what extend is Frisian actually used in every day conversation by people who are from places where the language is spoken.

## Background
Jongbloed-Faber, Lysbeth. "Meertalig whatsappen: Het taalgebruik van Friese jongeren op sociale media." Levende Talen Magazine 104.2 (2017): 24-28.

De Graaf, Tjeerd, Cor Van der Meer, and Lysbeth Jongbloed-Faber. "The use of new technologies in the preservation of an endangered language: The case of Frisian." Endangered languages and new technologies (2015): 141-149.

## Research question
How much The Frisian language is used in every day conversation?

## Hypothesis
I expect that Frisians dont use Frisian all that much in public conversations on twitter, except when their target audience for the tweet is other Frisians, but even in those situations I expect Frisian to be not that commonly used by the average twitter user. 

## Method
Data: Twitter data collected by the university of Groningen. I will use data from the first 3 months of 2022 in order to not create a needlessly massive dataset. 

I will keep track of every word used in both Friesland as well as the rest of the Netherlands in a python dictionary and see how many words are used in Friesland, that are hardly or not at all used anywhere else in the coutry. And what percentage of overall words this constitutes.
