# Milestone 5

## Description
In 2020 the covid-19 pandemic started and was at its height, especially in the news, but how has this widespread coverage affected discourse on twitter. 

## Background


## Research question
How did the twitter engagement towards covid change over the course of the pandemic?

## Hypothesis
I expect the discourse to mostly start at the end of january when the WHO declared covid a public health emergency of international concern and quickly ramping up in  march when the WHO declared covid-19 a pendemic. I then expect the discourse to slowly die down again with some peaks whenever a lockdown ends, starts or a new variant is discovered. 

## Method
Data: Twitter data collected by the university of Groningen. I will use data starting from december 2019 when covid was first discovered up to the end of 2022. 

I will collect every tweet mentioning the words "covid" and "coronavirus" and variations of these words in the dataset and keep track of when they were sent.
